I think this may come from our different personalities. I can be quite hot-headed and find it difficult sometimes to manage my temper. As a result, when we have a disagreement I usually want to take time to calm down before having a disscussion so that I do not escalate the argument further. My partner is more level headed and tends to want to resolve disagreements as soon as they arise. This can mean he feels frustrated when I need more time to get my anger in check before we talk it out.","While I still have many blessings and privileges in my life from my upbringing, my partner is from a higher socioeconomic background than me. Sometimes I feel jealous of the purchases he can make on nice things. Sometimes I feel less able to enjoy joint experiences because it is harder for me to afford (e.g. going out to a nice restaurant and paying half). Sometimes I find the way he talks about money to be a little bit alienating. In the rare times that we have met with his old friends from his very expensive secondary school, I find myself feeling a bit insecure or worrying that I do not belong in his social circle.","In the past, my partner has not been the best at giving gifts for special occassions (Christmas, birthdays, etc.). Last year he forgot to get me a birthday gift, which made me quite sad. He got me a gift of a necklace a few days later, but it broke after wearing twice. It is likely that my partner did not know that the necklace was defective, but it did hurt me that he did not seem to put much thought into getting a gift that would last after already forgetting my birthday. He did not replace the gift after it broke. 

I put this issue as least important as my partner has been understanding about how this experience made me feel and the most recent holiday (Christmas) I received a very thoughtful gift.",I want to focus on being a good student. I am starting a masters next year and want to make the most of the opportunity. I want to graduate with good career options available to me. I want to find a path to advance in my chosen field (chemical research).,"I want to be able to maintain my relationship next year when it will become long distance during my masters. Me and my partner currently spend a lot of time together, we live only 5 minutes apart, and we are both students at the same university. Next year I will be moving to another country for 12 months while my partner remains in Edinburgh. This will be a period of change for the both of us and I want to focus on putting work into keeping a positive relationship during this time that we are apart.","I want to gain more life experience and catch up on the things I missed out on over the past few years. I became a student the year that the pandemic began and feel that this has stunted my growth in some ways and that I missed out on experiences that I would have enjoyed. In particular, next year I want to travel more, try more types of food, and learn a new language (German).",5,6,7,6,6,2,4,4,3,3,3,Attach_3|Attach_4|Attach_8|Attach_7|Attach_1|Attach_2|Attach_5|Attach_6|Attach_9,"++IOSClosenessAronetal.,1992|++Commitment,SubscaleofInvestmentModel(Rusbultetal.1998)|++Global/GeneralAttachmentFraleyetal.,2011and2014|Support--DiscussionTopics(Biersteteletal.,2020)|Conflict--DiscussionTopics(Biersteteletal.,2020)|++RelationshipSatisfaction,SubscaleofInvestmentModel(Rusbultetal.1998)|++MindfulnessFFMQ(Baeretal.,2012)|++PRQCFletcheretal.,2000"

Cerys and I have different budgets and preferences on how to spend our money. A few weeks ago I proposed making a budget that we could use to track how much we were jointly spending, but Cerys found the idea too fussy, and thought that it would make our meals feel transactional, so we have ended up leaving our spending open and I think we are both unsure of how much we each contribute. Though this is unresolved and our 'most important' disagreement, it's not something we have ever actively argued over. ","Gifting has been one source of disagreement. In the past my friends and family have been relaxed around whether gifts are given exactly on a special occasion rather than a few days late / early. This also reflects my personal preferences when it comes to gifts I receive, since I generally don't mind if a gift is not given on time. I gave Cerys her birthday present a day late, which is when I learned that Cerys much prefers gifts to be on time. Since then all of my gifts have been given in advance, and I put more effort into anticipating what Cerys might like to receive.","Contributions of time and effort can sometimes feel unequal in the relationship. I sometimes feel that if I didn't organise when we spend time together and if I didn't plan something for us to do, we would not spend time doing anything at all. I also sometimes I feel that I plan my time around Cerys and often shift my schedule according to her needs, but that Cerys will almost never do the same.
